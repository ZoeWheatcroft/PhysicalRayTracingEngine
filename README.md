It is as faithful of a recreation that I could manage! 
Here are its measurements (location in x,y,z format): 
* Center sphere
  * size: radius of 1
  * location: (0, 1.03, -4.4)
* Back sphere
  * size: radius of 1
  * location: (0.87, 0.6, -2.0)
* Floor
  * size: (7.9, 0, 2)
  * location: (2.1, 0, 0)
* Camera
  * width: 1, height 0.5625
  * virtual viewpoint: (0, 1, -7.8)

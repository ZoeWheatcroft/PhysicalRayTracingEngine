**Setting the Scene**

Here is my Blender recreation of Whitted's sample scene: 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b49ea53-3ef2-499a-972b-2f8d33353361)

It is as faithful of a recreation that I could manage! It may be tiny bit off but it achieves a semblance. 
Here are its measurements (location in x,y,z format, y-up is positive): 
* Center sphere
  * size: radius of 1
  * location: (0, 1.03, -4.4)
* Back sphere
  * size: radius of 1
  * location: (0.87, 0.6, -2.0)
* Floor
  * size: (0.6, 0, 2.0)
  * location: (1.3, 0, 0)
* Camera
  * width: 1, height 0.5625
  * virtual viewpoint: (0, 1, -7.8)
  * rotation: (0, 0, 0)
